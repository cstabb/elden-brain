### KNOWN ISSUES
- Weapons
    - Ripple Blade, Torchpole have extraneous <br>s in its description
    - Noble's Slender Sword [Agheel Lake South] not formed correctly, links to "Agheel"
    - Nox Flowing Hammer, Serpentbone Blade now have Moveset not properly parsed out
    - "Leyndell Royal Capital" and "Leyndell, Royal Capital" are used
    - "Ancient Lightning Spear" missing from Skills
- Locations
    - Parses only imageg and the description
- NPCs
    - /Volcano+Manor+Spirit is excluded as it's missing an image and is a unique page, although there is some dialogue here possibly worth scraping
- Characters causing parsing issues:
    - /u2193

Check
- Bolt of Gransax has a strange link [[Leyndell Royal Capital]]
